//Instead of having parse logic within every post request, we want to extract that out into a function that we can reuse
//These functions are called Middleware - a function that does some pre-processing or pre-computing on the 'req' and 'res' objects. These are the primary means of code reuse for Express
//A Middleware function always has three arguments - req object, res object, and a next function

	//First, we only want to use this when we use the POST method, so we wrap this code in an if statement for that condition

				const [ key, value ] = item.split('=');
				formData[key] = value;
			}
			//instead of console.logging the formData, we will save that as the body property of our request object
			req.body = formData;
			//Finally, we call the next function. This means that we will pass our altered req and res objects into the callback function in our .post listener
			next();
		});
		//if this isn't a .post listener, we simply send it straight to our next function
	} else {
		next();
	}

//Now, for our .post() method, we include the Middleware function for parsing as a middle argument. We can have several Middleware functions that we tack on inbetween the path and the final callback function
app.post('/', bodyParser, (req, res) => {
	//now, instead of console.logging the formData, we console.log the req.body that we made equal to the formData in our Middleware function
	console.log(req.body);
